# side-markers-blinker
Trailer side markers blink with blinker, but not blink with hazzard lights.
## Tested on bench
Everything works as expected.
## Tested on vechicle
Work when lights is off. 
When lights on in circuit I found high frequency noise, I think this noise is from light bulb check, but I am not sure.
